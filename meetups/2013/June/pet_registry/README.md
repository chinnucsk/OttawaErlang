Personal Pet Registry: Super Simple ChicagoBoss Example
=======================================================

Introduction
------------

The goal of this project is to show the structure of a simple ChicagoBoss web
application.

In order to run this example, you should have a working ChicagoBoss
(https://github.com/evanmiller/ChicagoBoss) installation. Once you have it,
please edit the file boss.config and change the value of the "path" setting to
point to your CB folder.
